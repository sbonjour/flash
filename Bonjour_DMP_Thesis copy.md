**Data and Materials Produced**

Ten permanent water sites were selected from Konza prairie and sampled every ~70 days April 2015 - Jun 2016. Each sampling event consisted of depth and width measurements of the site, collection of water for ammonium and nitrate concentrations, gathering rocks for chlorophyll-a density, and benthic macroinvertebrate and organic matter using a 10 cm core. Nutrient concentrations were calculated using OI Analytical Flow Solution IV. Chlorophyll was extracted using the hot ethanol method with data stored as concentration per sample corrected for rock areas. Macroinvertebrates were enumerated, measured, and identified to the lowest practical taxonomic level. Organic matter was sorted, dried, ashed, and recorded as ash-free dry mass for each size class. Floating insect emergence traps were placed on a subset of eight sites during the summer of 2016. Traps were deployed for 48 hours every two weeks to measure variance during the season of emerging insect adults. Insects were collected from traps using a BioQuip Hand-Held Vac/Aspirator (BioQuip Products, Rancho Domingues, CA, USA) and preserved in 70% ethanol for sorting and family-level identification in the laboratory. Fishes were sampled seasonally from each of the 10 sites using single-pass backpack electrofishing or seining, depending upon the morphology of the site. Fishes were identified, total length measured, and returned to the stream. 

**Standards, Formats and Metadata**

Data will be saved as CSV files for cross-platform compatibility, exchangeability and longterm access. Metadata will be provided as an associated text object that includes methods used for each sampling regime and gps coordinates associated with each site. All files will include site, date, and replicate number. Metadata will follow the LTER Network Information system suggested guidelines. Separate data files will be produced for nutrients, chlorophyll, organic matter, benthic macroinvertebrates, emerging insects, and fishes. Associated units will be provided where necessary. 

**Roles and Responsibilities**

All data were collected by Sophia Bonjour with a field volunteer that was trained on site. Data were entered, cleaned, and formatted by Sophia Bonjour. Amanda Rothart analyzed and produced files for nutrient concentrations. Files will be prepared for the Kona Long Term Ecological Research Site database that is managed by a full-time information manager (currently Yang Xi) with changes in personnel managed by Konza LTER. 

**Dissemination Methods**

All previously mentioned files will be available for the public through the Konza LTER data portal, with future upload to the LTER NIS Data Repository. Sophia Bonjour will work with Yang Xi during the summer of 2018 to make the data available online. Abstracts for each of the data files will contain a method overview with descriptions of column headers for each data file. Data will be publicly available through http://lter.konza.ksu.edu/data. Any related publications will reference this repository for data. 

**Policies for Data Sharing and Public Access**

There are no permission restrictions, ethical, or privacy issues associated with these data. Data were collected under joint funding through Southern Illinois University and a National Science Foundation grant for Stream Invertebrate and Forest Cicada Studies on Konza Prairie. Sophia Bonjour will be the owner/creator of the data, but data are publicly available with associated DOI that can be cited for future use of the data. 

**Archiving, Storage and Preservation**

Macroinvertebrates sampled are preserved in 70% ethanol (preserved in the field with formalin) and available through the Southern Illinois University Zoology Department. Similar documentation of methods and organization scheme will be stored with physical samples at Southern Illinois University and with data archived through the Konza LTER data portal.
